# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Additional Packages to install:
npm install
npm install dotenv
npm install @google/generative-ai

First Update:
##(Renamed) Project Name: Nutri-Kcal
##Description A web application that helps users track their food macros through AI and Nutrition API estimates.

#Features
Functional Requirements:
- User Authentication: Users can sign up, and log in to application. (Changes be done later once application works as intended)

- Scan Barcode: Scan barcode, retrieve information of product from barcode API.(Currently in the works)

- Ability to retrieve and display information to user desired information (from one API and another API).

- Custom Food Entries: Allow users to manually enter food items and store that informations,

Stretch Goals:
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application works well on mobile and desktop devices. Update 1: No changes made yet as features in development. 

- Image Transcription Using AI: The application will send the image to an AI model (e.g., a cloud-based service like Google Cloud Vision or a custom-trained model) to identify and transcribe the food item from the picture. -Update 1: Currently working for text entries.

- Meal Planner: Based on the nutritional data, suggest meal plans for users according to their dietary needs.
- Dietary Recommendations: Provide tailored recommendations based on the user's dietary preferences or restrictions (e.g., low-carb, vegetarian, etc.).
